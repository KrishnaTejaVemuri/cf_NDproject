A major factor which results in loss of life is lack of awareness during such an event. This lack of awareness can be prevented by a significant amount, if we use the technology that we already posses in an effective way. 

 Solution to help cities from natural disasters.
 We want to develop an application which awares the app users of unfortunate natural occurences. 
 Our main objective is to inform the users of our app about the latest natural calamities in India, as soon as they occur.
 
 We want to acheive this by using a WEB CRAWLER, which retrieves information from various trusted websites and then sends a notification 
 stating the affected region along with the time and other important details pertaining to the disaster.
 
 It also sends notifications to the nearest helping organizations and groups which will give us a fair advantage by providing some help to the affected neighborhood with awareness of the situations and taking care of the victims.
